# Interactive Curriculum Vitae

This project is a combination of solving a web development exercise given to me, and a hope of potentially ending up with something to manage my CV and, more importantly, variants of my CV. *Everything* on the CV is not necessarily interesting and relevant for *every* position at *every* company one might want to apply for.

And since I don't like repeating myself, I don't want for example duplicate CV data spread out over several Word-documents. I'd like *one* place for my data, and the "several Word-documents" to be in sync with that.


## Currently thought requirements/goals/spec

1. Fulfill the requirements of the initial part of the exercise.
   * Just a stateless, interactive CV, limited to HTML, CSS, JS and jQuery.
2. Persistence of the CV data
   * Either in a database, in browser, export to a file, something... probably just as a file either locally or server-side.
2. A way to create customized "views" of this CV with certain things highlighted, emphasized, removed, adjusted, etc.
3. Persistance of customized views
4. Export to PDF
   * Alternatively/Probably just using a print stylesheet and print to PDF.
