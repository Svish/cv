Interactive Curriculum Vitae
===

A combination of a solution to a web development exercise I have to do because of reasons, and a hope of potentially having something to manage my CV data and, more importantly, variants of the CV. *Everything* on the CV is not necessarily interesting and relevant for *every* position at *every* company one might want to apply for. And I don't want the common data spread out in various documents, going outta sync, etc...

We'll have to see where it leads...
