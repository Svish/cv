# Interactive Curriculum Vitae

This project is a combination of solving a web development exercise given to me, and a hope of potentially ending up with something to manage my CV and, more importantly, variants of my CV. *Everything* on the CV is necessarily interesting and relevant for *every* position at *every* company one might want to apply for.


## Current thought goal

1. A single "db" of all my CV details
2. A way to create "views" of this CV with certain things highlighted, emphasized, removed, adjusted, etc.
